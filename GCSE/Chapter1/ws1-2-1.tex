\item
This worksheet is designed to test and reinforce the work we have done so far in chapter 1 titled \textbf{Number}.

\item \textbf{Show all your working out.}

\item Organize your work, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in
the space provided. If you wish for something to not be graded, please strike it out neatly. I will grade only work on the paper, unless you clearly indicate your desire for me to grade work on additional pages.

\item \textbf{Staple all your work}.

\item You may use any results from class, homework or the text, but you must cite the result you are using. You must prove everything else.

\item You needn't spend your time rewriting definitions or axioms on the paper.

\item 
You may use the text, my class notes and/or any notes and study guides you have created.
Do not use a \textbf{calculator} where possible in order to practise your mental maths skills.

\item
There are \numquestions\ questions in this homework worksheet. The total mark for this worksheet is \numpoints.
There are \numpages\ pages in this worksheet. 

\item When you have completed your work, hand it to me and go have a great week!

%\item There is a single bonus problem at the end of the test. It would be best to work first on the main test as this problem is only worth 5 points and will be graded strictly.
